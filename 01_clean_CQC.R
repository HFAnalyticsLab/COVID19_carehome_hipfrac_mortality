### What is it?
# A longitudinal record of care homes regulated by the CQC along with their characteristics,
# such as bed capacity, specialties, open and close date etc.

### Format
# - each row corresponds to a period of time (from start_date to end_date) for which the 
#  characteristics of one care home (ps_loc_id) were valid 
# - care homes can have multiple rows, that correspond to different time periods of different lengths

# Load raw data ---------------------------------------------------------------
# NB this refresh of the data seems to be encoded differently, had to use a different function
